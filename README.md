# NeoVim config

My vim config mainly designed to be used with neovim, with vimscript compatability at the top layer for use in tools such as ideavim.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository into your config directory (commonly `~/.config`).
    - `git clone https://github.com/osskari/nvim-lazy-config.git`
2. If you already have a neovim configuration set up that you don't want to lose, rename that directory to something else (ex. `nvim-old`).
3. Rename the cloned directory to `nvim`.
3. Delete `.git` and `.gitignore`.

## NeoVim

Just open up neovim and start having fun :)

## Jetbrains

 Source 'vim/idea-init.vim' in '.ideavimrc'.
<br>`source ~/.config/nvim/vim/idea-init.vim`.
